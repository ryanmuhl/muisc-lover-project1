Group Project 1
Purpose
Create a Front End application incorporating skills learned throughout 1st portion of Coding Bootcamp.

User Story
As a Music Lover I want an application where I am able to input a Music Artist/Band Name and display a list of their top 10 hits So that I can create a diverse play list, including a link to to song content allowing user to listen to song.

Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
When User Types in Artist/Band Name then selects Click button, A list of Top 10 songs for that artist will append to the designated song List field. Each song is designated as a clickable link.
When button is clicked and top 10 songs are displayed, the list is also saved to local storage.
When a specific song within the list is selected, a link will append to a second field. This link will take the user to the shazam video/url where user can listen to song.
When user selects a song link, the video/url link should save to local storage.
