# MUSIC-LOVER-PROJECT1
* Group Project 1

## Purpose
Create a Front End application incorporating skills learned throughout 1st portion of Coding Bootcamp.

## User Story
As a Music Lover
I want an application where I am able to input a Music Artist/Band Name and display a list of their top 10 hits
So that I can create a diverse play list, including a link to to song content allowing user to listen to song.

## Website Functionality/Class Criteria Met
* When User Types in Artist/Band Name then selects Click For Top 10 Songs button,  A list of Top 10 songs for that artist will append to the See List Of Songs Field.  Each of these songs is a clickable link.  
* When a specific song within the list is selected, a link will append to a second field (Select Shazams Song Link To Listen To Song).  This link will take the user to the shazam video/url where user can listen to song. This click event will also append the song to playlist field and save to local storage.  Local Storage is persistant on page reload.
* When Clear Lists button is selected, See List OF Songs and Select Shazam Song content will clear.  Local storage and playlist will remain until clear playlist button is selected. 
* When Clear Playlist button is selected,  all content on page will clear (including local storage), and page will re-load.
